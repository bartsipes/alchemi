Description: This document is an informal roadmap for Alchemi. Things may change over time.
Features may be added / dropped / modified, based on many things including user feedback.
This includes mainly the major features / issues. Time/priorities/milestones are not yet assigned.

Put your initials next to the task you would like to work on.

------------------------------------
- Configuration and set-up improvements 
	- Fix configuration and set up problems, particularly service-mode setup.
(TB)	- Options in DBInstaller to check for existence of database and remove it. Re-install is default.
	  also "verify option in database, so that the consistency is checked.".

- Scheduling and policy enforcement at Manager
	- Advanced scheduling (economy based, and other algorithms)
	- Refine API for plugging in custom schedulers.
	- Scheduling to take into account multi-user multi-app scenarios

- Fix stability related issues
	- Better error handling
	- Recovering gracefully from missing files, manifests etc.
	- Recovering from corrupt databases, automatically. easy manual reset / clean up of corrupt database

- Data handling capabilities
	- Problem: EmbeddedFileDependencies have limits. Huge files can't be passed across the network
	  using remote methods.
	- Develop a framework for handling data efficiently.

- Security 
	- Investigate security risks in the present design. Possible security enhancements include: 
	  transport level security, secure authentication, code-security (TCPChannels?, PKI GSI Auth? CAS?)
	- Check implementation of anonymous connections. (in both dedicated/non-dedicated modes).
	- Prevent spread of viruses using code-access-security, sandbox-execution of user-code
		
- Migration to .net 2.0 version
	- do we still keep v.1.x compatibility?

- Console improvements
	- Accurate reporting of application status : (it is now based on thread's status. need to fix this).
	- Details thread statuses. (different icons for threads with different statuses)
	- Job submitter GUI

- API and debugging enhancements
	- Inter-thread communication / shared memory
	- Include pdb along with module dependency so user knows line number where error ocurred
	- Restart thread 
	- make sure manager emulates all executor behaviour 
	  i.e. not only IExecutor interface (e.g. AbortThread), BUT stuff that an executor does 
	  (e.g. notifyisalive, relinquishthread)
	- decide whether the manager should be allowed to be a Non-dedicated node 
	  i.e. should be only restrict intermediate managers to connecting as dedicated excutors
	  * depends on #9, IF heirarchical architecture is implemented
	- GGF (global grid forum) standard WSRF XPManager Webservices
	- GGF-standard JSDL job interfaces

- Thread execution improvements
	- Find a way to return the actual standard error,output from the process to the client
	- Executor to accept more than one thread at the same time in case of SMP machines

- Robust multiclustering and scalability
	- P2P? Hierarchical managers? 

- Advanced configuration and policies for the Executor
	- Set on Executor, Manager: with Executor over-riding manager policies during scheduling 
	- Ability to specify, enforce all of the following policies, and a extensible framework that allows policy configuration:
		- local disk space available for dat/ eg 100Mb)
		- ram available to execute jobs (eg 16Mb)
		- cpu cycles available to execute jobs (eg 5%)
		- rate limit jobs (X per hour/day/week)
		- per user policies?
		- cost per usage : per Ghzhr, per MB, etc.

- Feedback and usage tracking
	- Options for users to email unexpected errors to the developers
	- Reporting of location, usage information (like Condor) to a central server?

- Executor GUI improvements
	- show info (no. of ghz hr?, no. threads etc.) on Executor. 
	- detailed reports like Console, but only for current Executor.
	  (eg. Applications run. date, time, user. Threads which are run by the executor. 
	  total time taken for app, threads etc...)
	  
- Performance monitoring and improvement
	- Detailed profiling and benchmarks, alchemi start up overheads
	  (eg. Linpack benchmarks for Alchemi?)
	- Compare with Boinc, Condor-for-Windows, G2, Platform, DataSynapse, GridMP, and other such stuff and assess strengths and weaknesses.

- Additional interfaces and tools
	- VS.Net 2005 plugin
	- Web-based Console interface

- Platform independence
	- Linux versions (manager / executor as daemons?) mono? java? both?
